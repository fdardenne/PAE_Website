# PAE_Website

:warning: This site is only a prototype and is discontinued.

A "proof of concept" site allowing students to encode their successful courses in order to get help on the courses to take the following year as part of their Computer Science training at UCLouvain.

The site asks the student to encode his courses, it then suggests the courses to take for the following year. We can very well imagine following steps allowing the student to encode his courses of this year and allowing the administration to validate/refuse his registration.
